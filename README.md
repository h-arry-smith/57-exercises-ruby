Solutions in Ruby for the 'Exercises for Programmers: 57 Challenges to Develop Your Coding Skills' from Pragmatic Programmers.

This code was written over the course of two months while learning Ruby, having read some tutorials of the language prior to this.
I am providing the code for curious learners to maybe gain inspiration from my solutions, but also to receive feedback from ruby programmers who are much stronger than me!
The following caveats apply to this code:
 * This is my first time writing ruby code, but my hope is to improve rapidly
 * I have for most exercises followed a test-driven-development protocol, but I am no means a professional, and have never worked in a real team, on a real code base. I hope to evolve my knowledge of TDD, and how to design and test well as my experience grows.
 * As I primarily focused on problem solving and learning ruby, there isn't a great deal of focus on if this code would run on another computer.
 * I completed a lot of, but not all of the challenges.
 * I mostly spiked out the final full programs without tests as at my current level, it was easier to think about how to solve the problem without the testing.
 
Hopefully you find it of some use. If you are an experienced rubyist and you have some suggestions on how I can improve the code, that is greatly appreciated.
