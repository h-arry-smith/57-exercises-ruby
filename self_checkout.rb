# In future exercise I need to start breaking out this code from one all encompossing
# class. For example in this code there are many distinct concepts:
#   - The Shopping Basket
#   - The Item
#   - Money as an object
#   - Receipts
#
#Â Now my familiarity with the language has grown considerably, I will start to
# this much better object oriented style and associated tests. This technique has
# served the learning so far but now it is time to evolve.
#
# For the first time I start to understand the reasoning and rationale behind SOLID
# and how to use OOP to my advantage. This insight has been hard to come by and will
# forever help me structure better, more readable and adaptable code. This book
# already pays for itself.
